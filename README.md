# BeeBetterAtBees

This mod adds a more clear bee-breeding guidance in form of breeding trees to NEI to add a little bit of support to help you breed the bees you want to have.

The mod itself is solely client-side, so it doesn't need to be installed on the server. Only the client needs it. So you can add it to your client without issue eventhough it might not be on the server!

**Requires Forestry and NEI to function!**
